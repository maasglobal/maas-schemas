## Index

The code is divided into several independent npm packages.

* [maas-schemas](maas-schemas) contains language independent JSON Schema type definitions

## Documentation

To generate documentation from JSON Schemas, execute:

```bash
npm run build
npm run docs
```

After that, documentation will be available in Markdown format in docs/ folder
and in HTML format in \_docs/ folder.

## Automatic Conversion

The maas-schemas-ts package is generated automatically from the maas-schemas package.
Travis won't accept any changes to maas-schemas unless you run the converter.
You can run the converter as follows.

```
npm install -g yarn                     # install yarn
yarn --cwd maas-schemas-ts              # install dependencies
yarn --cwd maas-schemas-ts convert-all  # run the converter
```

## Devops

The following commands should work in all packages where applicable.

```
yarn                              # install dependencies
yarn ci                           # perform a local CI test run
```
